The Odin Project Foundations course: Project Recipes

This project is the first in the TOP foundations course and demostrates my knowledge of HTML as of December 14, 2022. I will be building a basic recipe website that consists of a main index page which will have links to a few of my favorite recipes. I'll be revisting this project in the future to style it up with my acquired knowledge of CSS.

Looking forward for others and myself to see my progress as I complete the Odin Project! Manifesting a full-time remote developer job by the end of 2023. Let's go!
