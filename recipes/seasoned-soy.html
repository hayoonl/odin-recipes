            <h2>What is this dish?</h2>
                <p>This is not a dish on it's own but rather a dipping sauce/condiment/marinade!</p>
                <p>It adds extra flavor to your ordinary soy sauce - everything from tofu, meat, veggies, dumpling, noodles, eggs -- you get the point.</p>
                <p>You just need a few essential Korean pantry items to complete this delectable sauce. It tastes salty, sweet, savory, nutty, and even a little spicy if you want. It's typically served as a dipping sauce for fried foods like dumplings, Korean pancakes or spooned over tofu, veggies, rice! It has so many uses, I can't even write it all out. I keep a little jar of it in my fridge for whenever I want to add some additional flavor to my meals.</p>
                <p>Hope this sauce serves you well!</p>
