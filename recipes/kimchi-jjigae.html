        <h2>What is this dish?</h2>
            <p>This is my go-to comfort korean comfort food!</p>
            <p>My mom used to make this for me and my siblings a lot when we were young. It's a simple soup but it's warm, comforting, sour, sweet, salty and hearty! Sounds like a lot of flavors for just a soup - I know. But let me blow your mind with how simple and delicious this recipe is with just a bowl of rice.</p>
            <p>It's commonly cookied with variations of pork, such as pork belly, pork shoulder, spam, or sausages. Like many foods, the meat can vary by region like using fish, beef, or veggies! The linked recipe uses pork belly. </p>
            <p>Also, can't forget the staple kimchi! Kimchi is staple side dish in korean households - making this a super common dish amongst homecooked meals. Considering every household has jars and jars of kimchi varying in fermentation stages, it's perfect for when you have kimchi that has gone too sour to serve on it's own with rice. I would say this soup tastes better the more sour and old the kimchi is!</p>
            <p>It's also very cost friendly - making it a favorite for those college students who might only have kimchi, tofu and spam in their pantries.</p>
